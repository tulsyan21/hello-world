all the random thoughts put together
 
Hello people!!

Hope everyone's doing fine.
This repositry is to save all the updates and the projects I'll be doing.
First things first; need to learn the very basics of python.
I'll be working on Miniconda 3 and Sublime Text 3.
Keeping up the good work always!
